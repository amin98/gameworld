            <h1>Welcome to Gameworld!</h1><br>
            <p>In this website you can buy the best games from platforms like: Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC.<br>
                The pre-order function on this website isn't available yet... But we're working on it so stay tuned.<br><br>
                We're also gonna work with GW points (Gameworld Points). Every &euro;10,- you buy on games gives you 10
                points.<br>
                When you've collected 100 GW points you can choose a game for free!<br>
                (Under &euro;20,- of course...)
